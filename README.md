## Conclusion

In the end, our analytical journey has traversed the intricate landscape of data exploration, refinement, and visualization. Through the integration of Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the transformative capabilities of Tableau Public, we have unraveled nuanced insights into Walmart sales. Notably, as part of our meticulous approach, we conducted a thorough examination of linear regression assumptions, scrutinizing attribute correlations and evaluating the significance of each variable through p-values.

This journey, marked by outliers removal and dynamic visualizations, has not only enhanced the reliability of the dataset but also laid the foundation for future analyses. The creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard provides stakeholders with a powerful tool for exploring sales patterns effortlessly. As we conclude this phase, our project stands as a testament to the power of data-driven exploration in extracting actionable insights and fostering informed decision-making.
